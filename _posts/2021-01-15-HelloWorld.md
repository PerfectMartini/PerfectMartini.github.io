# Hello World!
January has already passed 15 days.<br>
It took 10 days to upload the first post.<br>
<br>

## Why?
Why did I start this blog?<br>

1. To practice GitHub<br>
2. To leave what I have studied<br>
3. To practice writting Markdown<br>
<br>

## Main Contents?
"So what should I post?"<br>

I haven't found an answer to this question yet.<br>
I am thinking.<br>

Maybe

1. Organization what I studied.<br>
    Instead of being tied to form, I'm just going to organize and post what I've done with even a few letters. Copy, PS, Math, ML etc...<br>
<br>

## Hmm...
Why can't Korean?<br>
