# Review : Make Blog
I record nothing until I posted the first post, so it's too difficult to write this review.<br>
I install many programs like WSL, jekyll ... I made My github.io by searching the Internet.<br>
<br>

## WSL
I reinstalled WSL on my computer. Microsoft explained it well. [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/ko-kr/windows/wsl/)<br>
<br>

## github.io
I referred to Korean blogs and copied other people's github.io.<br>
<br>

## jekyll
I had a hard time because of the bonder and ruby version. It is very difficult to explain in English.<br>
<br>

## Total Review
I should study html and markdown hard.<br>
I hope the next posts will not be boring posts with only text messages.<br>
